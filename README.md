# donuts-finder
Find Donuts using the TomTom Search APIs.

It was not as difficult! Using the fuzzy search around a bounding box ( The area of interest )

And of course you can change the query text to search for something different.

Check the docs here: https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/documentation#Services.services.fuzzySearch

happy .. Donut-ing ?
